# Mobile Price Predictor
This project is a web application developed to predict mobile prices based on device specifications. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically Linear Regression and Naive Bayes, implemented in Python with the Django framework. It also employs feature selection techniques to improve the accuracy of price predictions.

## Features

* Predicts mobile prices based on device specifications.
* Supports weighted feature selection for more accurate predictions.
* Utilizes Linear Regression and Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms.
* Developed using Python, Django, SciPy, Heroku, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
* Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting device specifications and obtaining price estimates.
* Deployed on Heroku for easy accessibility.
